# Team

A team is a group of [employees](employee/readme.md). It combines the settings and workflows to a group of people. In the real world a whole company, a department, a team or a sports club is a team.

A team has a set of predefined holidays and [absence types](../application/absence-type/readme.md) you can use.

Visually a team has a brand color and a name. A logo is also possible.
