# Invite an employee to your team

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw text-danger"></i> You have to be a manager to invite employees.

You can invite an employee by giving his email address and a welcome text. We send an invitation with your welcome text and an invitation link. The invited employee can accept the invitation following the link.

You can invite an employee already created or you can invite an employee which gets created by following the invitation link.

If you already have an employee created before the employee gets his assigned employee data shown for updating them during his registration process.

To meet legal regulations we only support invitation for employees that have the same mail domain as the manager itself. Each invited employee has a user account there he can [change his email](../../user-account/self-service/change-email.md) if needed.
