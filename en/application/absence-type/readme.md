# Absence Type

An absence type is a blueprint for an absence. It has attributes to control the behaviour an absence of this type gets handled. This means concrete approval workflow handling, deputy selection, quota-based approval or deny and so on.

You can [create](create-absence-type.md), [update](update-absence-type.md) and [delete](delete-absence-type.md) absence types.
